## Goal of the Project

The goal of this project was to practice writing object-orientated javascript. Almost everything of the code was provided by udacity. Only the functionality of the bugs and the player had to be finished (in the `app.js` file).

## How to cheat

Ofcurse there is a little cheat implemented. The player moves quite slowly, what makes the game hard. If he moves four times in a row downwards, his speed will be quintupled (only once)!
